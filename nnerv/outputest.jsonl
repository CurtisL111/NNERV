For addressing the technical hurdle against the development of this biomimetic technology, the present report describes the in-depth exploration and optimization over each critical preparation step, including establishment of a nanoparticle-stabilized dispersion system, cargo loading, membrane coating, and product isolation. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles loaded with DOX is used as a typical model for the coating with cancer cell membranes, providing compact DNP@CCCM nanostructure well-characterized by various techniques. Furthermore, the feasibility of this optimized approach in constructing biomimetic membrane-coated nanomedicines has been validated on the basis of the remarkably improved biofunctions, such as the targetability, magnetic property, hemolysis risk, macrophage evasion, in vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo circulation duration, and in vivo principal component analysis postinjection. We hope this study regarding technique optimization will prompt the advancement of biomembrane-camouflaged nanoparticles as a newly emerging biomimetic technology.", "spans": [["one", "CARDINAL", 133, 136], ["DOX", "ORG", 590, 593]]}

However, the poor solubility of Cum limits its further applications in the treatment of cancer. We have previously reported Cum-loaded nanoparticles (Cum-NPs) prepared with amphilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-polycaprolactone (mPEG-PCL) block copolymers. The current study demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy of Cum-NPs over free Cum in the treatment of lung cancer. In vivo evaluation further demonstrated superior anticancer effects of Cum-NPs by delaying tumor growth compared to free Cum in an established A549 transplanted mice model. Moreover, Cum-NPs showed little toxicity to normal tissues including bone marrow, liver and kidney at a therapeutic dose. These results suggest that Cum-NPs are effective to inhibit the growth of human lung cancer with little toxicity to normal tissues, and could provide a clinically useful therapeutic regimen. They thus merit more research to evaluate the feasibility of clinical application.", "spans": [["A549", "PRODUCT", 737, 741]]}
